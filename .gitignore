# Yarn
# Currently, I'm not adding the .yarn folder and .pnp loaders to version control. Uncomment the specific lines below, if
# you want to enable the associated feature, like patches, project specific yarn versions, offline mirror, zero-installs
# etc., at the expense of having to add these auto-generated source files to version control, which add noise and are
# hard to audit.
# See here for documentation: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored
# If you add .yarn/releases or .yarn/plugins to version control, you might want to consider adding a .gitattributes file
# as mentioned there, however with disadvantages: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7741#issuecomment-1228846511
.yarn
.yarn/*
# !.yarn/patches
# !.yarn/plugins
# !.yarn/releases
# !.yarn/sdks

# Swap these if you want to use the offline mirror or zero-install features (see https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching)
# !.yarn/cache
